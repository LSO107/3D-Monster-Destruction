# 3D Monster Destruction
##### Game Design &amp; Development

###### The game features a playable monster in a fully destructible environment. The aim is to achieve the highest score possible by causing as much destruction as possible in the given time constraint.
###### It was created in a group of four, over a 12 week period which includes design, implementation, presentation and evaluation.
###### The focus of the project was to create a complete and polished product. It has been designed to be a short replayable game and was developed with the mobile platform in mind, which was used to define the scope of our project. It has been optimised for mobile and would only require mobile controls to be implemented.
